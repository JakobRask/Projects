# Digit Recognition project

The project is based on the MNIST data set with handwritten digits 0-9.
The aim for this project is to build and evaluate different Machine learning models to be able to predict handwritten digits.

With a Streamlit application the best model is used to predict a handwritten digit held infront of the web-camera.


# Streamlit app

* Download the files and use pip to install streamlit (and/or other libraries in requirements-list)
* Run main.py from terminal <streamlit run streamlit_app.py>
